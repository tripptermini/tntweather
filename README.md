## Daily Snow
As we get closer to the actual storm cycle, I can see some advances in the stormâ€™s potential strength. I am hoping this cycle is on the higher end of snow totals, but I could see it going either way. The total percipitable water just keeps going up for April 11th - 13th. My predicted snow totals just keep going up in my mind.
